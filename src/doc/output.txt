For easier reading by third-party program, extracted scores will be normalized:

If ingames hiscores are spread on multiple tables, it will be the same on the extraction.
In case of multiple hiscores tables, each table will have an id, representing the table criteria.

table
  id (optional, only if multiple tables are present)
  1st column (mandatory) = RANK  = integer, starting at 1 (lower is better)
  2nd column (mandatory) = SCORE = integer or float
  3rd column (optional)  = NAME  = any printable ASCII character or any Unicode character in UTF-16 encoding (ex: &#9786;)
