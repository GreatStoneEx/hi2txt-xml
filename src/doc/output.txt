For easier reading by third-party program, extracted scores will be normalized:

If ingames hiscores are spread on multiple tables, it will be the same on the extraction.
In case of multiple hiscores tables, each table will have an id, representing the table criteria.

main tables
  id (optional, only if multiple tables are present)
  1 RANK  column (mandatory) = integer, starting at 1 (lower is better)
  1 SCORE column (mandatory) = integer or float (separator => .)
  1 NAME  column (optional)  = any printable ASCII character or any Unicode character in UTF-16 encoding (ex: &#9786;)
