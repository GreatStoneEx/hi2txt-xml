<!-- I changed the hiscore.dat for this game.
The problem here was that it observed 4 values:
@43: 3 bytes of score
@48: 1 byte (value=a9) to wait for end of initialization.
At 48h I could see that this variable was used as a loop index or something similar.
So a9 was just a very temporary value.
On my machine the match did not happen on startup, but at some random time during the game.
So I changed it to wait for a more stable data at address 10b. It's 0 on startup and gets initialized to 50h after a few seconds.
this uses the trick with 0 length: 0-length data is tested but not saved or loaded.
